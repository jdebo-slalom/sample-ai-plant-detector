**Status**: COMPLETE
**Goal**: Establish the foundational project structure and development environment

### Decisions Made:
- ✅ Used Vite (not CRA) for faster builds
- ✅ TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- ✅ Skipped React Router (single page app)

### Tasks:
1. ✅ **Initialize React Project**
   - ✅ Created with Vite + React + TypeScript
   - ✅ TypeScript with verbatimModuleSyntax enabled
   - ✅ ESLint configured

2. ✅ **Install Core Dependencies**
   - ✅ AWS SDK v3 (@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime)

2. ✅ **Image Processing Utilities**
   - ✅ Base64 encoding for Bedrock API
   - ✅ Image validation functions
   - ⏭️ Skipped compression (Bedrock handles it)

3. ✅ **UI/UX Elements**
   - ✅ Loading states during analysis
   - ✅ Error handling with user feedback
   - ✅ Responsive design with max-width

4. ✅ **State Management**
   - ✅ useState for image, loading, results
   - ✅ Proper cleanup of object URLs

## Phase 3: AWS Bedrock Integration ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Goal**: Implement the core AI analysis functionality using Amazon Bedrock

### Decisions Made:
- ✅ Claude 3 Sonnet model for vision analysis
- ✅ Direct browser-to-Bedrock calls (no backend proxy)
- ✅ JSON-structured prompt for consistent responses
- ✅ Comprehensive debug logging with console.group
- ✅ Support for temporary credentials (session token)

### Tasks:
1. ✅ **AWS Configuration**
   - ✅ BedrockRuntimeClient with credentials
   - ✅ Support for access key + secret + session token
   - ✅ Configurable region and model ID
   - ✅ Debug logging for troubleshooting

2. ✅ **Bedrock Service Integration**
   - ✅ Created bedrockService.ts
   - ✅ Claude 3 Sonnet vision model
   - ✅ Error handling with detailed logging
   - ✅ Base64 image encoding

3. ✅ **Prompt Engineering**
   - ✅ Structured prompt for disease/pest ID
   - ✅ JSON response format requirement
   - ✅ Requests: disease, severity, confidence, recommendations

4. ✅ **Response Processing**
   - ✅ Parse JSON from Claude response
   - ✅ Extract structured data
   - ✅ Type-safe AnalysisResult interface

## Phase 4: Results Display and User Experience 🔄
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Create an intuitive interface to display analysis results and recommendations

### Decisions Made:
- ✅ Basic results component created
- ✅ Color-coded severity display
- ⏳ Need to enhance UI/UX

### Tasks:
1. ✅ **Results Display Component**
   - ✅ Disease/pest identification display
   - ✅ Confidence scores
   - ⏭️ Skipped: Visual highlighting (not in scope)

2. ✅ **Remediation Recommendations**
   - ✅ Structured list of recommendations
   - ✅ Color-coded severity (red/orange/green)
   - ✅ Step-by-step instructions

3. ⏳ **Additional Features** (Optional)
   - ⏳ Export/print functionality
   - ⏭️ Skipped: Social sharing
   - ⏭️ Skipped: Save/bookmark

4. ⏳ **Enhanced UX** (Optional)

4. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)
   - Usage analytics
   - Performance monitoring
   - User feedback collection

## Technical Considerations

### AWS Bedrock Models Recommended:
- **Claude 3 Sonnet/Haiku** for vision analysis
- **Anthropic Claude** for generating detailed remediation plans

### Key Dependencies:
```json
{
  "@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime": "^3.x.x",
  "react": "^18.x.x",
  "react-router-dom": "^6.x.x",
  "axios": "^1.x.x",
  "react-hook-form": "^7.x.x"
}
```

### Environment Variables:
```
# Vite uses VITE_ prefix (not REACT_APP_)
VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
VITE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
VITE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
VITE_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your_session_token  # Optional for temp credentials
VITE_BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0
```

## Success Metrics:
- Image upload success rate > 95%
- Analysis completion time < 30 seconds
- User satisfaction with recommendations
- Error rate < 5%
