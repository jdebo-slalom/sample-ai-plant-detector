# Plant Disease/Pest Analysis App - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
A React web application that allows users to upload plant images, analyzes them using Amazon Bedrock's vision capabilities to identify diseases/pest infections, and provides remediation recommendations.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure
**Goal**: Establish the foundational project structure and development environment

### Tasks:
1. **Initialize React Project**
   - Create new React app using Create React App or Vite
   - Set up TypeScript configuration (recommended for better type safety)
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality

2. **Install Core Dependencies**
   - React Router for navigation
   - Axios or fetch for API calls
   - AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 (@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime)
   - Material-UI, Tailwind CSS, or similar for UI components
   - React Hook Form for form handling

3. **Project Structure Setup**
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   ├── pages/
   ├── services/
   ├── hooks/
   ├── types/
   ├── utils/
   └── assets/
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up environment variables for AWS credentials and Bedrock configuration
   - Create .env files for different environments

## Phase 2: Image Upload Interface
**Goal**: Create a user-friendly interface for image upload and preview

### Tasks:
1. **Image Upload Component**
   - Drag-and-drop functionality
   - File input with validation (file type, size limits)
   - Image preview before upload
   - Support for multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)

2. **Image Processing Utilities**
   - Image compression/resizing for optimal API usage
   - Base64 encoding for Bedrock API
   - Image validation functions

3. **UI/UX Elements**
   - Loading states and progress indicators
   - Error handling and user feedback
   - Responsive design for mobile/desktop

4. **State Management**
   - React hooks for managing upload state
   - Image data storage and management

## Phase 3: AWS Bedrock Integration
**Goal**: Implement the core AI analysis functionality using Amazon Bedrock

### Tasks:
1. **AWS Configuration**
   - Set up AWS credentials (IAM roles, access keys)
   - Configure Bedrock client with proper permissions
   - Implement authentication and authorization

2. **Bedrock Service Integration**
   - Create service layer for Bedrock API calls
   - Implement image analysis using Claude 3 or similar vision model
   - Handle API responses and error cases

3. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Design effective prompts for plant disease/pest identification
   - Structure prompts to return consistent, parseable responses
   - Include context about plant types, common diseases, and remediation

4. **Response Processing**
   - Parse and structure Bedrock responses
   - Extract disease/pest identification data
   - Format remediation recommendations

## Phase 4: Results Display and User Experience
**Goal**: Create an intuitive interface to display analysis results and recommendations

### Tasks:
1. **Results Display Component**
   - Disease/pest identification results
   - Confidence scores or probability indicators
   - Visual highlighting of affected areas (if supported)

2. **Remediation Recommendations**
   - Structured display of treatment options
   - Severity assessment and urgency indicators
   - Step-by-step remediation instructions

3. **Additional Features**
   - Save/bookmark results functionality
   - Print or export recommendations
   - Share results via email or social media

4. **Enhanced UX**
   - Before/after image comparison
   - Progress tracking for treatment plans
   - Educational content about identified issues

## Phase 5: Error Handling and Optimization
**Goal**: Implement robust error handling and optimize performance

### Tasks:
1. **Error Handling**
   - API error handling and user-friendly messages
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Invalid image format/size handling
   - Rate limiting and quota management

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Image optimization and caching
   - Lazy loading for components
   - API response caching where appropriate
   - Bundle size optimization

3. **Loading States**
   - Skeleton screens during analysis
   - Progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Timeout handling for API calls

4. **Accessibility**
   - ARIA labels and semantic HTML
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment
**Goal**: Ensure application reliability and deploy to production

### Tasks:
1. **Testing Implementation**
   - Unit tests for utility functions
   - Component testing with React Testing Library
   - Integration tests for API calls
   - End-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright

2. **Security Considerations**
   - Secure handling of AWS credentials
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Content Security Policy implementation

3. **Deployment Setup**
   - Configure build process for production
   - Set up hosting (AWS S3/CloudFront, Netlify, Vercel)
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - CI/CD pipeline setup

4. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)
   - Usage analytics
   - Performance monitoring
   - User feedback collection

## Technical Considerations

### AWS Bedrock Models Recommended:
- **Claude 3 Sonnet/Haiku** for vision analysis
- **Anthropic Claude** for generating detailed remediation plans

### Key Dependencies:
```json
{
  "@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime": "^3.x.x",
  "react": "^18.x.x",
  "react-router-dom": "^6.x.x",
  "axios": "^1.x.x",
  "react-hook-form": "^7.x.x"
}
```

### Environment Variables:
```
REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
REACT_APP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
REACT_APP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
REACT_APP_BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0
```

## Success Metrics:
- Image upload success rate > 95%
- Analysis completion time < 30 seconds
- User satisfaction with recommendations
- Error rate < 5%
